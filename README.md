#1 Post
Hello, my name is John Selders, a developer with a thirst for knowledge. My journey in the world of programming began 
about 2 years ago and I'm still constantly learning as I go! I'm always eager to learn new technologies, tackle challenging problems, and collaborate with fellow developers.


My Goals:
1. Sharing Knowledge: I believe that knowledge should be shared and accessible to all. 
2.Building a Portfolio: GitHub will serve as my digital playground, where I'll showcase my coding projects, contributions to open-source initiatives, and the evolution of my skills.
3.Collaboration: GitHub is not just a platform for solo endeavors; it's a hub for collaboration. I'm eager to connect with like-minded developers, work on exciting projects, and contribute to the open-source community.

Expectations:
In-depth discussions on development topics that pique my interest.
Insights into my coding projects, both personal and collaborative.
Tutorials, guides, and how-to articles to help fellow developers overcome hurdles.
Reflections on my progress and the lessons I've learned on this journey.

 Feel free to leave comments, ask questions, or connect with me on GitHub
